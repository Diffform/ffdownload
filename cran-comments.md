## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed backtick to a single tick in the DESCRIPTION description. Additionally I added the link to the website in the form <https://...>
* Replaced Author & Maintainer by Authors@R
* Placed single quotes around 'xts'
* Changed the version number to only have three digits: 1.0.3 (as this one includes my changes)
* Changed the URLs in the readme file
  
## Test environments

* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
